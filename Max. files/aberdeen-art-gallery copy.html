          <p>In a self-initiated brief for my HND course I decided to do a rebrand for Aberdeen Art Gallery's Winter 2017 reopening. The identity had to be modern, and sophisticated without being antiquated. It needed to appeal to all ages, so it had to have some kind of vibrancy to it.</p>

          <p>I knew that in order to have this kind of broad appeal, I should look into fluid logo design and create something that was always distinctive, but could adapt to many different contexts in terms of who it was aimed at and the medium in which it was appearing.</p>

          <p>The final version of the basic logo forms a pyramid from the negative space in Helvetica Bold’s capital A, which was originally the font I was going to use. After I’d decided I needed something more impactful, I tried to do the logo with Langdon’s capital A but it was too thin to hold imagery. As well as a pyramid, a symbol of authority, the logo resembles the alchemical symbol for Air, a classical element associated with intelligence and spirit, the Latin word "spirare" / "to breathe" being an ancestor of the English words "aspire", "inspire" and "perspire".</p>

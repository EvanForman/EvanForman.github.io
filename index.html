	<h1 id="topheader">Evan Forman</h1>
	<p>I’m a writer interested in the fictions creeping into our increasingly warped reality, the mythology of modernity, and spooky interactions with the more-than-human world. I’ve been published in a couple of small press anthologies and this year I’m working on a novel.</p>

	<!-- Angelus Novum -->

	<h2><i>Angelus Novum</i></h2>
	<p>When a neanderthal is exiled from her tribe and faces starvation, she must form a  relationship with an exotic creature and the abundant, invasive ecosystem growing out of it. She returns to her old family bearing strange new gifts, will they accept?</p>
	<p><a href="redirects/angelus-novum.html">Medium - 12min read</a></p>

	<!-- Cwej: Down The Middle -->

	<h2><i>The Eternal</i></h2>
	<p>Novella for the licensed Doctor Who anthology <a href="https://www.arcbeatlepress.com/cwej.html"><i>Cwej: Down The Middle</i></a>, following burned-out former companion Chris Cwej.</p>

	<p>Chris, traumatised by an interplanetary war between eldritch horrors, is mysteriously evacuated to an idyllic world where war is an ancient myth, poverty unthinkable, and empathy contagious. Before he can get a moment's rest, he must solve the case of a woman who remembers being murdered over and over again. Every time she recalls the unstoppable monster that killed her the event is a little bit closer to here and now; they have until sundown.</p>

	<blockquote><p>…the ideas at the heart of stories such as Ring Theory, Crushing Reality, The Mushroom at the End of the Universe and The Eternal are smart existential horrors that maintain and develop the essence of what always made Faction Paradox stories compelling … These are stories which use the concept of hauntology in fiction the way the artists of the Ghost Box label do musically: exploring ruins, cannibalizing and repurposing them to present new and often startling ideas.</p>
	<p><b>Jon Arnold, We Are Cult</b></p></blockquote>

	<!-- 10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad -->

	<h2><i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i> and <i>Mud Nostalgia</i></h2>
	<p>Two novella-length stories in <a href="https://arcbeatlepress.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html#">Arcbeatle Press'</a> <i>10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad</i> shared-universe anthology.</p>

	<p>In <i class="quoteital">&lsquo;Enitharmon&rsquo;</i>young Lucy is moved to her mother's isolated childhood home: an alien manor designed in a virtual world and built on a crack in reality. As ghosts from her mother's past start calling out from the VR memory box, can Lucy find a solution in the world she's only ever visited in dreams and nightmares?</p>

	<p>In <i>Mud Nostalgia,</i> a spy on the abortive colony ship Magellan has gone missing. Decades ago the ship was bought by old-money Silicon Valley elites and moved to the edge of the solar system as an isolated libertarian holdout. Our stiff-upper-lip reporter is sent in to trace the spy's last movements and get out, but follows his trail into the deadly status games of a eugenics-obsessed gentry, down through the urban warzones on the lower decks, and further down into the guts of the ship where only the hated &lsquo;savages&rsquo; thrive. If this account is not the record of a shattering mind, what he found there might have already changed everything.</p>

	<!-- The Keepers of Time -->

	<h2><i>The Keepers of Time</i></h2>
	<p>For Michael Robertson and James Wylder's <i><a href="http://www.jameswylder.com/lady-aesc.html">Lady Aesculapius</a></i> series. A cozy night in on Aesculapius’ travelling moon becomes a tour of her museum of clocks from alien cultures all over the multiverse. Come see curiosities like the world-famous Papier&shy;mâché&shy;henge, the un&shy;think&shy;about&shy;able Grandmother Clock, the clock from the capitalist planet where time is money and the socialist planet where money was replaced with time, and the watched clock that never ticks.</p>

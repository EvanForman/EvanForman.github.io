	<p>I’m a writer interested in the fictions creeping into our reality, the mythology of modernity and spooky interactions with the more-than-human world. I’ve been published in a couple of small press anthologies and this year I’m working on two books.</p>

	<h2><i>Angelus Novum</i></h2>
	<p>Short story. In this excerpt from the lost exofeminist manifesto, the text moves from dense theory to impressionistic fiction. It tells the story of a neanderthal woman, exiled from her tribe, who is drawn into a symbiotic relationship with an alien creature and the invasive ecosystem growing out of it.</p>

	<h2><i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i> and <i>Mud Nostalgia</i></h2>
	<p>Two novella-length stories in <a href="https://arcbeatlepress.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html#">Arcbeatle Press'</a> massive <i>10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad</i> shared-universe anthology</p>

	<p ><i class="quoteital">"Enitharmon"</i>is a gothic fairytale nightmare about a mother haunted by digital ghosts and a daughter whose imaginary friends are trying to lure her to the other side of the veil, set in a house designed in a virtual world and built on a crack in reality.</p>

	<p>In <i>Mud Nostalgia</i>, our stiff-upper-lip reporter takes us to the failed interstellar colony ship Magellan, which was bought and populated decades ago by old-money Silicon Valley elites fleeing government interference on Earth. Now, the eugenics-obsessed gentry play deadly status games on the upper decks and ambitious young coders commute through urban warzones below, but in the dark, abandoned heart of the ship the hated "savages" are experimenting with new laws for a new form of nature.</p>

	<h2><i>The Keepers of Time</i></h2>
	<p>For Michael Robertson and James Wylder's <i><a href="http://www.jameswylder.com/lady-aesc.html">Lady Aesculapius</a></i> series. A cozy night in on Aesculapius’ travelling moon turns into a mind-bending tour of her museum of clocks collected from alien cultures all over the multiverse. Come see curiosities like the world-famous Papiermâchéhenge, the unthinkaboutable Grandmother Clock, a suitcase full of cash from where time is literally money and the watched clock that never ticks.</p>

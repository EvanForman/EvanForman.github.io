	<h1 id="topheader">Evan Forman</h1>
	<p>I’m a writer interested in the fictions creeping into our increasingly warped reality, the mythology of modernity, and spooky inter&shy;actions with the more-than-human world. I’ve been published in a couple of small press anthologies and this year I’m working on a novel.</p>

	<!-- Angelus Novum -->

	<h2><i>Angelus Novum</i></h2>
	<p>Short story. A neanderthal woman, violently exiled from her tribe, is drawn into a symbiotic relationship with an alien creature and the invasive ecosystem growing out of it.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.evanforman.com/angelus-novum.html">Medium - 12min read</a></p>

	<!-- 10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad -->

	<h2><i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i> and <i>Mud Nostalgia</i></h2>
	<p>Two novella-length stories in <a href="https://arcbeatlepress.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html#">Arcbeatle Press'</a> massive <i>10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad</i> shared-universe anthology</p>

	<p ><i class="quoteital">"Enitharmon"</i>is a gothic fairytale nightmare about a mother haunted by digital gho&shy;sts and a daughter whose vivid fantasies have started leaking out from the other side of the veil, set in a house designed in a virtual world and built on a crack in reality.</p>

	<p>In <i>Mud Nostalgia</i>, our stiff-upper-lip reporter takes us to the aborted inter&shy;stellar colony ship Magellan, which was bought and moved to the edge of the solar system decades ago by old-money Silicon Valley elites fleeing government inter&shy;ference on Earth. Now, the eugenics-obsessed gentry play deadly status games on the upper decks and ambitious young coders commute through urban war&shy;zones below; in the dark, abandoned heart of the ship, the hated "savages" experiment with new laws for a new form of Nature.</p>

	<h2>Upcoming</h2>
	<p><i>The Eternal</i> - novelette for the Doctor Who universe antho&shy;logy <a href="https://www.arcbeatlepress.com/cwej.html"><i>Cwej: Down The Middle,</i></a> following burned-out former comp&shy;anion <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Cwej">Chris Cwej.</a></p>

	<p>Chris has spent weeks, months, po&shy;ssibly years as a lone agent, weaving his way through future and past to con&shy;tain an inter&shy;planetary war be&shy;ween eldritch forces; he is failing. Caught in a time loop of cyclical stru&shy;ggle and death, Chris is mysteriously shunted out of the war and into a pastel mea&shy;dow. Here in this idyllic world, he is taken in by members of a utop&shy;ian society where war is an ancient myth, poverty un&shy;thinkable, and empathy contagious.</p>

	<p>But before he can get a moment's rest, Chris must try to solve the im&shy;possible problem which brought him here: a woman who thinks about her past and rem&shy;embers being mur&shy;dered. One by one, her past selves are being devoured by an unstoppable creature which massacres everything in its path to get to her. Every time she tries to remember how she fought or fled, and how she inevitably failed, it's a little bit closer to here and now. They have until sundown. (Out Oct&shy;ober 29th.)</p>

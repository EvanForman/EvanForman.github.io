	<p>I’m a writer interested in the fictions creeping into our reality, the mythology of modernity and spooky interactions with the more-than-human world. I’ve been published in a couple of small press anthologies and this year I’m working on two books.</p>

	<h2><i>Angelus Novum</i></h2>
	<p>Short story. A neanderthal woman, violently exiled from her tribe, is drawn into a symbiotic relationship with an alien creature and the invasive ecosystem growing out of it.</p>
	<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2D9AO56">Medium - 12min read</a></p>

	<h2><i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i> and <i>Mud Nostalgia</i></h2>
	<p>Two novella-length stories in <a href="https://arcbeatlepress.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html#">Arcbeatle Press'</a> massive <i>10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad</i> shared-universe anthology</p>

	<p ><i class="quoteital">"Enitharmon"</i>is a gothic fairytale nightmare about a mother haunted by digital ghosts and a daughter whose vivid fantasies have started leaking out from the other side of the veil, set in a house designed in a virtual world and built on a crack in reality.</p>

	<p>In <i>Mud Nostalgia</i>, our stiff-upper-lip reporter takes us to the aborted interstellar colony ship Magellan, which was bought and moved to the edge of the solar system decades ago by old-money Silicon Valley elites fleeing government interference on Earth. Now, the eugenics-obsessed gentry play deadly status games on the upper decks and ambitious young coders commute through urban warzones below; in the dark, abandoned heart of the ship, the hated "savages" experiment with new laws for a new form of Nature.</p>

	<h2><i>The Keepers of Time</i></h2>
	<p>For Michael Robertson and James Wylder's <i><a href="http://www.jameswylder.com/lady-aesc.html">Lady Aesculapius</a></i> series. A cozy night in on Aesculapius’ travelling moon turns into a mind-bending tour of her museum of clocks collected from alien cultures all over the multiverse. Come see curiosities like the world-famous Papiermâchéhenge, the unthinkaboutable Grandmother Clock, a suitcase full of cash from where time is literally money and the watched clock that never ticks.</p>

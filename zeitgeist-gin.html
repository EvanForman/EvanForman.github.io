          <p>For my HND graded unit I chose to do the branding for an unnamed, fictional micro-distillery that had opened in Aberdeenshire. The client wanted the branding to be individual to stand out in a competitive market, and to not use any clichés or obvious Scottish themes.</p>

          <p>My market research found that gin is undergoing a worldwide renaissance, especially amongst 18 to 30-year-olds, and the client wanted the branding to appeal to this market specifically. I looked at different gin companies and found that almost all of them were working within the same field of Victorian / outright colonial tropes in their branding. “Okay,” I thought. “What’s the most modern thing we could possibly do?”</p>

          <p>I fixated on the word “renaissance” in the brief, and looked at three historical art/design movements that sought to throw off the past and find something new: Renaissance art, international typographic style and the Bauhaus. But despite the good intentions, I’d have still been mining history for inspiration. I looked for something that could only exist in the mainstream 2010s, and ended up at a place between Vaporwave and glitch art.</p>

          <p>The thing that interested me most about this concept was the process behind databending. I could have replicated the effect in Photoshop, but I thought that actually manipulating image data would yield more interesting results. The two methods I used were <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Xkcq6">editing image data in TextEdit</a> and <a href="https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/">importing the image data into Audacity</a>, adding effects to the audio track and exporting the audio as a .jpg.</p>

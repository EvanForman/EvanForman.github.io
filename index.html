	<h1 id="topheader">Evan Forman</h1>
	<p>I’m a writer interested in the fictions creeping into our increasingly warped reality, the mythology of modernity, and spooky interactions with the more-than-human world. I’ve been published in a couple of small press anthologies and this year I’m working on a novel.</p>

	<!-- Angelus Novum -->

	<h2><i>Angelus Novum</i></h2>
	<p>Short story. A neanderthal woman, violently exiled from her tribe, is drawn into a symbiotic relationship with an alien creature and the invasive ecosystem growing out of it.</p>

	<!-- 10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad -->

	<h2><i>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</i> and <i>Mud Nostalgia</i></h2>
	<p>Two novella-length stories in <a href="https://arcbeatlepress.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html#">Arcbeatle Press'</a> massive <i>10,000 Dawns: Poor Man's Iliad</i> shared-universe anthology</p>

	<p ><i class="quoteital">"Enitharmon"</i>is a gothic fairytale nightmare about a mother haunted by digital ghosts and a daughter whose vivid fantasies have started leaking out from the other side of the veil, set in a house designed in a virtual world and built on a crack in reality.</p>

	<p>In <i>Mud Nostalgia</i>, our stiff-upper-lip reporter takes us to the aborted interstellar colony ship Magellan, which was bought and moved to the edge of the solar system decades ago by old-money Silicon Valley elites fleeing government interference on Earth. Now, the eugenics-obsessed gentry play deadly status games on the upper decks and ambitious young coders commute through urban warzones below; in the dark, abandoned heart of the ship, the hated "savages" experiment with new laws for a new form of Nature.</p>

	<h4 id="Report">Report</h4>
	<p>This is a high-level critique of the piece best suited for early drafts. Though I aim to be as thorough and in-depth as possible, this isn't the granular work you'll get from my annotations; what I want to produce here is an actionable list of recommendations saying no, you're not crazy, yes, this is worth pursuing, okay, here’s everything you need for a great next draft.</p>

	<h4 id="Annotation">Annotation</h4>
	<p>This is a mixture of traditional line editing and a sentence-by-sentence guided tour of the piece: pointing out the stuff that really works, enhancing that where we can, suggesting tweaks at the level of the line or paragraph which will improve the structure as a whole. Traditionally this is work to be done on later drafts, but my annotations are more holistic than strict line editing so this would be a very comprehensive treatment for an early draft; consider this if you’re looking for a quick turnaround.</p>

	<h4 id="Report + Annotation">Report + Annotation</h4>
	<p>Here's the package deal: the most bang, full stop. You have two options. I can send you the report and an annotated manuscript at the same time—this is how we beat that deadline—or I can give you the report on your first draft and annotate another whenever you’re ready, going in with a much deeper understanding of the relationship between you and the work and what you want to achieve with it.</p>

	<h4 id="Copyediting">Copyediting</h4>
	<p>I am not a copyeditor and I do not do copyediting, but I'll point out anything I see in the annotations and I know plenty of great proofreaders I can pass your work to. As we reach the victory lap we can discuss your budget for this and see who we can get on side.</p>

	<p>"Evan brings out the best in your prose—without diluting your style or voice. He's meticulous, detailed, and exactly the kind of editor you want to work with to make your writing both beautiful to read and easy to understand."<br>

	<p>"Evan has an incredible talent for sorting through a story to make each sentence more impactful and efficient. His notes are always valuable, whether he's providing minute word-by-word edits that sharpen every line or bigger-picture structural changes that tighten the entire plot. Most of what I know about story structure comes from his invaluable advice."<br>
